# Review Checklist

This file serves as a small reminder of all acceptance criteria. The
purpose of the list is to ensure consistent review practices. However,
it should not be taken as a guideline, but rather as a constant
reminder.

| nr | criterion |
|----|-----------|
| 1  | Do code-changes match issue-statement? |
| 2  | Is Documentation properly updated to reflect the changes/additions? |
