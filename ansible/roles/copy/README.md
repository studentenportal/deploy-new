Copy
====

Copies files/directories recursivly to the host. Practice showed that
_Jinja 2_ cannot process binary files correctly.

When the path is not a temporary file, the folder gets copied _before_
the copy operation. When the updating of the files fails the script will
automatically recover the old folder structure.

While writing the library I assumed that all content, with a _dest_
property set, with value will not end up in an autogenerated tmp folder.
Therefore, the script will not provide recovery function to
autogenerated tmp folders. If the files are meaningful write them
somewhere else.

### Pitfalls
1. The folder which src points to will not be copied, but it's childs
2. Role only templates files with the _.template_ ending and removes the ending
3. If file should be owned by root, explicit owner + group attributes needed
4. If mode is not given, the local file mode is taken for the file
